# pong_game
Day 22 of 100.

The game starts off a bit slow, however, with each rebound, the pong ball goes a bit faster than before. As the round progresses, the pong ball will increase in speed and won't slow down until a point is won/lost. This involved a deeper understanding of the turtle module and enabling 'listening' for each paddle. They can be controlled with the 'w', 's', 'up', and 'down' arrow keys respectively.
